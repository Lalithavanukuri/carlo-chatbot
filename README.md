# carlo-chatbot


Our project focuses on providing support and assistance to cyber-bullied victims through an AI-powered chat-bot embedded in a user-friendly website. Leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) technologies, we have developed two chat-bots to cater to different aspects of victim support.

The website, thoughtfully designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, serves as a secure platform for users seeking help and guidance. The first chat-bot, developed using the versatile Botpress framework, acts as a guidance bot, effectively addressing the victim's concerns and offering helpful advice to cope with cyber-bullying incidents.

In addition, we have integrated a friendly bot into the website, powered by the BrainShop API. This bot utilizes advanced NLP capabilities to foster empathetic and understanding conversations, creating a comforting and supportive environment for victims seeking emotional assistance.

The seamless deployment of these chat-bots within the web app enables easy accessibility for users facing cyber-bullying issues, providing them with a confidential and safe space to seek help and advice. Through this project, we aim to make a positive impact on victims' lives, promoting mental well-being and empowerment while combatting cyber-bullying in a proactive and innovative way.
